# Functions, Subsitution model and scope

## Functions: in a non-computer context

The highest point of Victoria Peak is 552 metres. What is highest point of Victoria Peak in feet?

You may know 1 metres = 3.281 feet. Therefore, 552 metres can be converted into feet by:

```
552 * 3.281 = 1811.11
```

Another way to represent the same idea is to create a function, suppose we define a function called `f(x)`
